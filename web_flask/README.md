## General

* What is a Web Framework
* How to build a web framework with Flask
* How to define routes in Flask
* What is a route
* How to handle variables in a route
* What is a template
* How to create a HTML response in Flask by using a template
* How to create a dynamic template (loops, conditions…)
* How to display in HTML data from a MySQL database

## Copyright - Plagiarism
* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

* All your modules should have documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
* All your classes should have documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
